# nn_modles_lib

## Purpose
This repo stores NN model that trained in Simulation, Simulator is based of Autonomy-Research-Testbed (https://github.com/uwsbel/autonomy-research-testbed). 

### Use case
In folder of tracking, the NN takes error state vector $\mathbf{e} \in \mathbb{R}^4$ and return a control input vector $\mathbf{u} = [throttle, steering] \in \mathbb{R}^2$.
